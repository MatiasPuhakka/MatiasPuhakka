# Hey there! 👋

I'm Matias, a fullstack developer who enjoys building clean, functional web applications. Most of my work lives in private repositories, but feel free to explore what's available here!

🪚 Currently learning carpentry while spending my working hours with React, TypeScript, and Node.js. I work fluently in both Finnish and English.

👨‍💻 I've recently wrapped up helping rewrite a patient portal for a major Finnish healthcare provider and am always interested in new challenges and collaborations.

🌐 Want to connect? Drop me a line at matias@koodikko.fi - I'm always up for chatting about projects, tech, or whatever's on your mind!
