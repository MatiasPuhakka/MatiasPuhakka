# Hey there, nörtit! 👋

I'm Matias, a software developer with a passion for creating awesome websites and applications, with a keen eye for *aesthetics*. Welcome to my GitHub profile, where you'll find a mix of not much, honestly. All of my greatest code lie behind locked doors in repositories hidden from the public. Feel free to take a look around, anyway, and if you manage to find anything interesting, feel free to "borrow" some code (with attribution, of course 😉).

- ⏳ Leaning Svelte and Swift

## What I'm up to 👨‍💻
