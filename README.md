# Hey there, nörtit! 👋

I'm Matias, a fullstack software developer passionate about crafting awesome websites and applications with a keen eye for *aesthetics*. Most of my coolest code is hidden in private repositories, but feel free to explore what's available here!

🚀 I'm currently learning Svelte and Swift, and loving both so far. Fluent in Finnish and English, I enjoy working on visually appealing UIs and love tackling new challenges.

👨‍💻 At the moment, I'm working on a project for an unnamed Finnish social security provider using React and NodeJS. I'm always open to collaborations and improving user and developer experiences.
